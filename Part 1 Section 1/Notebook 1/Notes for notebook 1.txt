The main purpose of the Notebook is to compare perforamnce of 3 agents:

Sarsa vs Q-Agent vs Random Agent


Coding material:
1) Jupyter notebook for sequential code runnning.  This notebook also compiles the metrics together on the same graph. 
2) Multiprocessing.py module for running the training in parallel -- run  notebook_1_multiprocessing.py from command line to take advantage of paraller code running.
